## step #1
- Navigate to your directory of choice 
- Once there run the following command `npx create-react-app app_name` 
- This will generate a react app in your chosen directory, navigate using `cd` into that directory.

## step #2
- Once in the root directory you can run `npm run start` and `npm run test` to check that the app is working the default port to see the app is http://localhost:3000/ 
- Once everything is running correctly you can delete the default designs and create a `components` folder in the `src` folder. 
- I the `components` folder create a `Home.js` file (you can name it anything you'd like).
- You will write your code here. 
- Import the `Home` component you create in that file to the `App.js` file and render it withing the app page. 

## step #3
